# Danamitra  

Danamitra is a socially-driven mobile application prototype designed to reduce food wastage by connecting food donors with NGOs. The app uses **AI-powered matching** to ensure that surplus food from restaurants, events, caterers, and households is efficiently delivered to NGOs that serve underprivileged communities.
